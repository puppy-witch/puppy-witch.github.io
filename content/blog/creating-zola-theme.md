# Tlachtga - My First Zola Theme

I've built a custom Zola theme called **Tlachtga** that is retro but also relatively accessible and lightweight.

## Features (Ideally, we shall see how this progresses)

### üñ•Ô∏è Multiple Terminal Modes
- **Retro**: Classic green phosphor with CRT effects
- **Amber**: Warm amber terminal (new!)
- **Dark**: Modern dark mode
- **Light**: Clean 'light' (by my standards) mode (gross)

I plan to add a purple phosphor theme later.

### Accessibility Features
- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader optimisation  
- High contrast options
- Reduced motion respect

### Other

- Custom shortcodes for content, witchy theme
- Intentional, purposeful design (or at least attempting at one)

## Try It Out
The theme is open source and available at:
[github.com/puppy-witch/tlachtga-theme](https://github.com/puppy-witch/tlachtga-theme)

This is still in active development, we shall see if and when this progresses how it shall.
